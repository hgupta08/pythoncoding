
classattribute:
When you access an attribute via an instance of the class, Python searches for the attribute
 in the instance attribute list. If the instance attribute list doesn’t have that attribute,
  Python continues looking up the attribute in the class attribute list. Python returns the
   value of the attribute as long as it finds the attribute in the instance attribute list
    or class attribute list.

1) Storing class constants
2) Tracking data across of all instances
3) Defining default values

#instance method
In a class, an instance method is a function that takes the current
 instance as its first argument. In Python, this first argument is called self by convention.
 The self argument holds a reference to the current instance, allowing you to access that instance from within methods. More importantly, through self,
 you can access and modify the instance attributes and call other methods within the class.

To define an instance method, you just need to write a regular function that accepts self as
 its first argument. Up to this point, you’ve already written some instance methods.

@classnethod

can be asscced therough class name as well as object name.Use  @classmethod to make it cmethod
t. However, class methods should be accessed through the corresponding class name
 for better clarity and to avoid confusion.
 It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class.
 For example, it can modify a class variable that would be applicable to all instances.
 . In practice, you often use class methods for methods that create an instance of the class.
